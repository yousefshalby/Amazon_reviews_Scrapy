Amazon Customer,Works great but charger given doesn't work,4.0 out of 5 stars,The charger given does not charge the ipad. We tried there school charger they have done there online schooling and works perfect. Wouldnt charge with the one sent or the one I bought. Strange
TR,Be ready to return it,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product came looking real nice I booted it up had Apple help me adjust it. After a few days the safari window when turned lengthwise had a blank spot, then it started freezing up where my touch wouldn‚Äôt work for about 30 seconds refurbished I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll buy it again"
Trevor,I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and I would buy from this seller again.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical about buying a refurbished Apple. I didn‚Äôt want to spend 50% more on a new one though. This thing came like brand new with perfect battery health and perfect condition. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and I would buy from this seller again.
Sandra Dale,Refurbished. I pad,3.0 out of 5 stars,My granddaughter selected  this for me and it does not work as well as my old one. ItSeems to freeze up often andI have to turn off or slant.  Wish I had spent a little more money and gotten a brand new one. Disappointing.üò¢
Marilyn Curley,Loved the I pad air but plug sent was sub standard.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my I pad air! It looks brand new, works perfectly. It came with an Apple lightning cord but the plug was sub standard and got very hot after about 10 minutes. I threw it out and got an apple plug. Problem solved. It‚Äôs been 3 months since purchase. Works perfectly and am very happy with the purchase."
LC,Extremely happy with purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely pleased with this purchase. Excellent like-new condition, everything functions as expected. This refurb saved me from being without an iPad due to a ‚ÄúBoot Loop‚Äù battery issue on my old one. Not able to afford a new one at this time, I was concerned with taking a risk. So far so good and, unlike some, I‚Äôm perfectly fine with the inclusion of a generic charger/cable. Glad to have something come with a refurb at all! If you prefer Apple to generic, Apple‚Äôs online store sells not only the ‚ÄúApple‚Äù brand but provides a selection of compatible products at varying price points. So overall, I gladly give this transaction a 5 Star rating and highly recommend seller!"
Dinger,iPad 10.5inch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVED this new iPad, however it would not allow any app uploads or iOS updates, the company returned my money quickly and was responsive to my questions. Will be buying another iPad soon."
L. Brown,As described,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, üíØ"
Alex Phipps,Could‚Äôve told me it was new.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I opened this thing up, I was sure there would be some weird abnormality on it some where, but it was like new. The only complaint I have is that it came with an after market charger but I already high quality chargers anyways so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal for me. Unbelievably good purchase, would recommend to anyone looking to get and iPad."
Cindy,Might be refurbished but works brand new,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely need to get a new charger because the iPad doesn't come with its original one, but honestly no issues other than that. It works perfectly and in the month I've had it I haven't had any real issues. I bought an apple pencil to go with it and a wireless keyboard and they work perfectly fine. Definitely worth my money."
Van G.,Really good condition,5.0 out of 5 stars,Guess I got lucky. No scratches on screen or case so that would be excellent for me. I stress tested it with everything I know to do and no problems. Not an apple charger but it is a 12W. Definitely a screen improvement from an Ipad mini 4Couldn't justify brand new since I use it mainly for flying DJI drones so bought this to get the Celluar also but I don't activate just plug in an att sim to silence it.
Jordan,Received broken...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Product looks perfect. But most likely sent to me with the same problem it got sent in for. When I press near the home button I get lines all through the display. I‚Äôm thinking about trying another. Might just break down and buy new...
Ogler Tomas,L√≠nea blanca en la pantalla,4.0 out of 5 stars,El producto me lleg√≥ con una l√≠nea blanca en la pantalla en la parte de arriba
Amazon Customer,Good value - but check the charging block!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. It works well. As refurbished, it does have a few wear scuff, but the screen is in great shape and it‚Äôs working well. My only complaint is that they sent it with an IPhone charging block, so it took more than 8 hours to charge. Once I realized it needed a different charging block (12W or 18W, not 5W that came with the iPad) I bought one. It‚Äôs now charging as expected. Would‚Äôve given 5 stars if it came with the correct charging block."
Incognito,"Very, very pleased",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Item arrived in 2 days via FedEx. Packed superbly. Even though it is a renewed item, you could never tell it. Maybe a few vague smudges on the back. Screen is perfect. It performs flawlessly. Whew! Charger included is not official Apple brand but is a ZTE made in China brand but it is correct type and charges well. Seller was very responsive to all my questions and professional. This was money well spent. Would buy from these guys again with no hesitation. Recommended"
Connie M,No response from manufacturer!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product wouldnt keep a charge.  The way i understood, if not satisfied it could be returned within 90 days for a FULL refund.  Must have been charged almost 50% restocking fee.  Tried to contact them twice, never heard from the company as to why.  Will never purchase from them again."
charlie d,Screen failed right after return date expired,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely disappointed in this product.  I purchased it as a refurbished item to  save money....unfortunately, the screen failed after two months, just after the return date had expired.  It cost $400 to replace the screen so I should have purchased a new one and saved money.  I will never buy from this vendor again."
Jimmy,Can i please have an Apple charger? Thanks..,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything works great with the iPad, however the charger that came with it isn‚Äôt Apple certified, it‚Äôs a 5v knock off brand charging cube when this iPad needs the 12v Apple certified cube as well as the fake the cord it came with. 5v charger cube destroys battery life and charges 1% every 10 minutes"
Tom,"Indistinguishable from new, but has all the usual iPad problems",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:4:3 screen is good for reading and note taking.Good color accuracy on screen.LightweightGood graphics performanceFingerprint readerGood battery life.Like-new conditionCons:No USB port.Awful speakers, and they‚Äôre only on one of the smaller edges.No swipe keyboard on iOSNo place to store stylusiOS has poor multitasking. No way to vertically stack apps. Some apps can‚Äôt be run out of full screen. No non-tall Picture in Picture mode"
gcj,Very satisfied,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had doubt at first on this since it's renewed. I usually buy brand new to avoid any hassle or getting a doa. In fact I wanted to cancel it but it was already shipped even when it said it will be week away. I received it in 3 days. I  may have just been lucky since what I got look so new. I think it may have been a display item. It came with the box, charger and cable. It set me up as if a new ipad. Very happy :-)"
Elida Salinas,Incorrect charger included.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ipad was in good shape but didn‚Äôt come with any of the original parts included chargers or cable. The wall charger it came with isn‚Äôt even cable of charging the iPad since it is a 5w charger and not the 12w charger iPads come with. The listing should specify this somewhere and to my knowledge it doesn‚Äôt.
JH,Cheap Defective charger,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spent $500 dollars for a refurbed iPad that has cheap Apple rip off Charger that is defective.
Amazon Customer,It aint what its supposed to be,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Viewed their website and saw Ipad Air 3 advertised as having cellular and WiFi capability for $479.00............ordered it and was shipped 2 days later.......information displayed the same Ipad Air 3 I viewed and ordered was the item being shipped....upon delivery, Ipad Air 3 was identified as having WiFi only capability, no cellular ..........contacted the seller who stated stated I ordered the WiFi only model.......went back to my order and shipment pages to see if I had made an error......nope, both pages confirmed that I had purchased and paid for the Ipad Air 3 with cellular and WiFi options.  Advised the company of my findings and that I could verify the facts.........they stated that if I wanted the cellular option, they would sell me one......for an additional cost.............paid the post office $15.00 and sent it back......appears that the company may be dealing in a ""bait and switch"" tactic...........my opinion is DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!  (you can go to the company website and select Ipad Air 3, 64 gb., price $479.00  and in the product description it will state that the item has both cellular and WiFi options included)"
Sky Fulton,"You would not know this was a ""renewed"" iPad Air (current generation), that nice......",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The iPad came very well packaged and arrived on time.  The only clue it wasn't new was a sticker on the back of the box, the actual correct Apple box (so it was was packed as new).  And maybe the luck of the draw vs some of the other reviews noting the non-Apple charger (and in defense the listing did say it was to be a non-Apple charger), in the box was a new (still wrapped in the factory plastic film wrap) 12 watt Apple OEM charger.  This indeed was a 2019 Apple iPad Air 64Gb WiFi iPad, indistinguishable from new.  Very happy with the device, the price, and the seller."
Michael Patrick,Poor performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,Locks up a lot and doesn‚Äôt always want to connect to WiFi
MIN Z.,Good deal for me,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.          ¬†I updated to ipad os 13and it works great. There  are a little scratch on the screen if you look it carefully, but not a big problem for me, if you have a screenprotector you can even not see it. Only one essential point is there are no original power adapter and charging wire, if you mind about this, be careful. At last I have to say it is a really good deal, I can get $100 cheaper compare to buy a new air3, and it works good."
JohnnyG,Great deal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The previous reviews are correct, it comes with substandard 5W charger. However, this product is just as good as a new one as far as I can tell. Great deal, I was glad to get this for almost $100 off. No noticeable signs of being used, and the performance is exactly what you would hope for. If the charger is a deal breaker, do not purchase this. Otherwise it‚Äôs as good as new."
Esvin,Great condition,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like most of the reviews say yes you don't get original cable but that's not really a big deal, the iPad itself came in absolute perfect condition, not a single scratch on it and I got to save $200 getting it renewed over new, so overall I'd say it's definitely worth it."
Tvan,It was not as expected,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wonder why the box was not sealed and there is a rift on the apple symbol.
Haley Robinson,Counterfeit Parts and Useless Customer Service.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The iPad I received began flashing a purple screen frequently restarting (5-10 times a day), rendering it pretty much useless. At the apple store, they said it was due to the item having a counterfeit screen. Customer service was useless and told me they could not replace the item. Then when I inquired about receiving a counterfeit product, they stopped responding all together. The replacement screen will cost me about $150. What a waste; I could have bought something new directly from Apple with the amount of money I'm shelling out to fix the broken product they sold me."
